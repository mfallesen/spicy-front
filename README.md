# Krydda

## Description
  Krydda is my solution to having to constantly check to see what spices I have in my spice cabinet. It's a two part application consisting of this React Front end and a Node.js and MySQL backend API. Users can sign up for an account for free using only their email and username. No other data is needed from the user. Passwords are encrypted serverside. Logged In users are given access to their virtual spice rack where they can add/sort/and edlete spices from their rack. They also have access to a limited User Profile which allows them to delete their account if they wish to do so. There is also a password recovery system being implemented.

## Usage 
  The application asks users to either log in or sign up for an account. Users who do not have an account are redireacted to the registration page while users with existing accounts are sent to the log in screen. Once logged in the user is taken straight to their virtual Spice Rack. In there they are able to add or delete to their spice racks.
  
## Future Development
  This is a one man project and so development is slower than would be typical with a team of 2-3 other devs. Additional features that I'd like to implement once V.1.0 is finished would be adding a seperate table  for sauces and dressings. Additionally allowing users to create a bit more customized profile (profile Pic instead of avatar) is also a desiresd implementation. The ultimate goal for this app is to create a Progressive Web App that users can have installed on phones or tablets that will sync with the server if they lose connection.
